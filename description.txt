Website Hyperlink: https://teechenxing.github.io/blog/

For the website, I set the default font to be roboto + mono to give the site a simplistic/minimalistic design. 
To go with this minimalist design, I decided to use the least number of colors for the text and pictures. The text would 
either be black or white, with the navigation bar text turning gray when on hover. For the symbols underneath the Contacts section,
I chose symbols that are black and white to match the text. In terms of customization, I added a javascript function that allowed the 
text to be "typed" on-screen to make the website look somewhat lively along with a moving background image.
