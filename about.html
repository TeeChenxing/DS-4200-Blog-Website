                    <p>
                      This is the story of Indra, once whole, now navigating the
                      debris of his own life. His parents dead, Indra takes
                      revenge on the one responsible for their demise, and in
                      the pursuit, he succumbs to the consequences, meeting his
                      end. However, fate takes an unexpected turn as he
                      reincarnates into a world pulsating with mana and
                      magic. Yet, the enchanting surroundings can't dispel the
                      shadows of his haunting past. In this poignant tale of
                      resilience, Indra's journey becomes a testament to the
                      indomitable spirit, forcing him to confront not only
                      external challenges but the internal demons that threaten
                      to consume him. Can he weave together the remnants of his
                      life and find redemption in this new world that seeks to
                      break him once more?
                    </p>

                    <h3>Story Theme</h3>
                    <p>
                        My series won't be about "good vs. evil" or "light vs. darkness." Instead, it will explore the gray areas of morality, 
                        where characters are often forced to choose between options that are all wrong. I want to create a realistic world where 
                        many times, no right choice exists. If Indra were faced with the decision to gain more power to protect those he loves 
                        or save a stranger, he would abandon the stranger without hesitation. 
                        There's no shame in inaction—only power matters, as Indra recalls:
                        <blockquote class="blockquote">
                            <p class="blockquote__text">
                                Power cannot grant you happiness, but weakness cannot grant you anything.
                            </p>
                        </blockquote>
                    </p>

                    <h3>Magic System</h3>
                    <p>
                        I plan to base my magic fantasy within the genre of <i>Progression Fantasy</i>, 
                        where our protagonist, Indra, grows stronger step by step throughout his journey. 
                        This genre emphasizes that the protagonist's strength and power play a key role in shaping 
                        the story. The magic system will feature clearly defined levels of power:
                        <ol>
                          <li>
                            Eternal (Strongest)
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            Perpetual
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            Ascendant
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            Awakened
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            Initiate
                          </li>
                          <li>
                            Manaphyte (Weakest)
                          </li>
                        </ol>
                      </p>
